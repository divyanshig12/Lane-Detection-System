# Lane-Detection-System

I implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to automatically detect road lanes, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane recognition. For this project, I utilized the TensorFlow framework, which provided robust tools and libraries essential for developing and training the neural network. This approach significantly improved the detection process, ensuring reliable and precise identification of road lanes in various driving conditions.
